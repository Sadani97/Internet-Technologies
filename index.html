            Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral
            nerves. Understanding brain function is essential for unraveling the mysteries of human behavior, cognition,
            and
            emotion.

        <p style="font-size: large;">
            The brain is the most complex organ in the human body. It produces our every thought, action, memory,
            feeling
            and experience of the world. This jelly-like mass of tissue, weighing in at around 1.4 kilograms, contains a
            staggering one hundred billion nerve cells, or neurons. The complexity of the connectivity between these
            cells
            is mind-boggling. Each neuron can make contact with thousands or even tens of thousands of others, via tiny
            structures called synapses. Our brains form a million new connections for every second of our lives. The
            pattern
            and strength of the connections is constantly changing and no two brains are alike. It is in these changing
            connections that memories are stored, habits learned and personalities shaped, by reinforcing certain
            patterns
            of brain activity, and losing others.

        Neuroplasticity: How the Brain Adapts and Changes
    </h2>

    <p style="font-size: large;">
        Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt to new experiences and stimuli. It's also known as
        neural plasticity or brain plasticity. It has the ability of the nervous system to change its activity in
        response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or connections after
        injuries, such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI).
